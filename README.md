Implemented the SMS spam detector by using the classification models , Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis . Spam Collection dataset is used as a dataset. The dataset is modified as comfort for the further process and applied the NLP techniques like tokenization, handling stop words, applying the regular expression, porter stemmer on the dataset and finally converted the outcomes from the NLP techniques as a corpus and used that for the count vectorization . For the classification, applied the Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis models. Estimated accuracy ,precision, recall, f1-score,confusion matrix and ROC curve for both the models.Compared the both models performance based on the accuracy,precision, recall , f1-score,confusion matrix and ROC curve.
